# toukabotrequests

`toukabotrequests` is the web app to accompany the 
[toukabot](https://github.com/jbillote/toukabot) Discord bot.

Its main primary purpose is to allow users to request to add images to existing
commands. Note that this serves only to manage the main bot, of which there is
no public URL to add to a Discord server.

## Features

* [ReactJS-based frontend](https://github.com/jbillote/toukabotrequests-frontend)

## TODO
[ ] Implement CSRF login
